Disease,Testing
squamous cell carcinoma,"Depending on where the tumor develops (i.e., the skin or nail bed), a diagnosis may be achieved with a fine needle aspiration (FNA). FNA involves taking a small needle with a syringe and suctioning a sample of cells directly from the tumor and placing them on a microscope slide."
lymphosarcoma,"lymphoma requires finding cancerous cells on microscopic examination. In this test, a veterinarian will insert a needle into an area of concern (an enlarged lymph node, enlarged kidney, thickened region of intestine, or fluid present within the chest) and remove a small number of cells. These cells will then be examined under a microscope, looking for cancer cells that indicate lymphoma."
diabetes,"Generally, the following screening tests are performed when diabetes mellitus is suspected: a complete blood count (CBC), a serum biochemistry profile, and a urinalysis."
feline immunodeficiency virus,"During this acute phase, FIV can usually be detected in blood with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing from two weeks post‐infection, and anti‐FIV antibodies detected from four weeks post‐infection. Uncommonly, seroconversion can be delayed for two months or even longer in some FIV‐infected cats."
feline leukemia virus,ELISA-type tests detect the presence of free FeLV particles that are commonly found in the bloodstream during both the early and late stages of infection. The indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) test is usually sent out to a diagnostic laboratory after a positive ELISA test to confirm FeLV infection.
heartworm,"Diagnosing feline heartworm disease will typically involve a complete blood count and blood chemistry profile, chest X-rays, a test to determine whether the patient's blood contains antibodies to the parasite and a test to see whether adult heartworm proteins are present in the blood."
rabies,The direct fluorescent antibody test (dFA) is the test most frequently used to diagnose rabies. This test requires brain tissue from animals suspected of being rabid and can only be performed post-mortem.
ringworm,"Veterinarians diagnose ringworm by fungal culture, examination with an ultraviolet lamp, and direct microscopic examination of hair or skin scale."
upper respiratory infections,PCR is very sensitive and specific. The turnaround time for results is usually 2-3 business days which allows for timely patient and population management. Several diagnostic laboratories offer Feline URI PCR panels that test for multiple viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in a single sample.
worms,"The PCR test is a sensitive test for detecting the presence of the upper respiratory pathogens Chlamydophila felis, Feline Herpesvirus and Feline Calicivirus. The test is most reliable in cases with clinical disease."
kidney disease,Veterinarians will most often turn to blood tests and urine analysis (urinalysis) to evaluate the concentrations of waste products and other components that healthy kidneys normally filter or regulate.
gingivitis,"Looking at your teeth, gums, mouth and tongue for signs of plaque, irritation or swelling. Measuring the pocket depth of the groove between your gums and teeth. A dental probe is inserted beside your tooth beneath your gumline, usually at several sites in your mouth."
periodontitis,Examine your mouth to look for plaque and tartar buildup and check for easy bleeding. Measure how deep the pockets are between your gums and teeth by placing a tiny ruler called a dental probe between your teeth and gumline. Pockets are measured at several places in your upper and lower gums.
tooth resorption,"A dental professional will diagnose internal resorption when the dentin or cementum becomes absorbed into the tooth canal, causing the tooth's inner and outer surfaces to become inflamed. When a tooth is injured, its tissue becomes inflamed and absorbed into the tooth root."
obesity,"You can assess your cat's body condition at home by checking how much fat they have covering their ribs and comparing that to the feel of your hand. Start by feeling the cat's ribs just behind their front legs. If the ribs feel like the back of your hand, your cathas an excellent body condition."
pancreatitis,"Pancreas-specific lipase is measured with a test called Feline Pancreatic Lipase Immunoreactivity, known simply as fPLI. The test requires only a simple blood test. A fasting sample is preferred, but it is not essential for the accuracy of the test."
hyperthyroidism,"Diagnosis of feline hyperthyroidism can usually be accomplished by measuring T3, T4 , and/or free T4 in a single baseline blood sample. The T3-suppression test is used for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in cats that have normal T3 , T4 , and/or free T4 concentrations but appear clinically hyperthyroid."
