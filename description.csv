Disease,Description
squamous cell carcinoma,"SCC can be highly variable in appearance. Tumors may appear as a shallow or deep sore (ulceration), a raised, reddened area, or a cauliflower-like growth. Multicentric SCCs arise as pigmented areas on the skin, which become ulcerated (break open) and bleed. These areas are painful and can become scabby in appearance. SCC in cats can be variable in appearance. Initial growth can look like a scab or a red, thickened area of skin. Tumors slowly progress to ulcerations in the skin. Some tumors can be more proliferative (mass-like) and look like a raised growth whereas others will look more red, flat, plaque-like or ulcerated."
lymphosarcoma,"Lymphosarcoma (lymphoma) is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in cats. It is a cancer of the lymphocytes (a type of blood cell) and lymphoid tissues. Lymphoid tissue is normally present in many places in the body including lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow. Cats with renal lymphoma often present with signs of kidney disease, like increased drinking and urinating, weight loss, and nausea. Cats with multicentric lymphoma often have firm hard swellings under the chin, on the shoulder, and behind the knee, while nasal lymphoma symptoms can include sneezing or nasal drainage."
diabetes,"Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. There are 2 main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes – a lifelong condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. type 2 diabetes – where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin properly."
feline immunodeficiency virus,"FIV (Feline immunodeficiency virus) is a viral infection that affects cats. It causes affected animals to have a weaker immune system in comparison with non-FIV positive cats. FIV initially results in a short-lived illness that's often not even noticed by a cat's owner. Inflammation of the gums and severe dental disease, known as gingivostomatitis, is common in cats infected with FIV, and they are significantly more likely to develop cancer and immune-mediated blood disorders than healthy cats. Weight loss, seizures, behavioral changes and neurological disorders are all possible."
feline leukemia virus,"FeLV adversely affects a cat's body in many ways. It is the most common cause of cancer in cats, may cause various blood disorders, and may lead to a state of immune deficiency that hinders a cat's ability to protect itself against other infections. Feline leukemia virus and all other retroviruses produce an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. The retrovirus is able to insert copies of its genetic material into cells in which they would like to infect. Feline Leukemia Virus is circular in shape and consists of an envelope, a nucleocapsid, and a nucleiod."
heartworm,"When heartworms (called Dirofilaria immitis) infect the heart or lungs of an animal, it causes a condition called heartworm disease. These worms look like cooked spaghetti and can grow to be 8 to 12 inches long. Heartworm disease is a serious disease that results in severe lung disease, heart failure, other organ damage, and death in pets, mainly dogs, cats, and ferrets. It is caused by a parasitic worm called Dirofilaria immitis. The worms are spread through the bite of a mosquito."
rabies,"Rabies is a viral zoonotic disease that causes progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Clinically, it has two forms: Furious rabies – characterized by hyperactivity and hallucinations. Paralytic rabies – characterized by paralysis and coma. Rhabdoviruses are approximately 180 nm long and 75 nm wide. The rabies genome encodes five proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L). All rhabdoviruses have two major structural components: a helical ribonucleoprotein core (RNP) and a surrounding envelope."
ringworm,"Ringworm is a common infection of the skin and nails that is caused by fungus. The infection is called “ringworm” because it can cause an itchy, red, circular rash. Ringworm is also called “tinea” or “dermatophytosis.” The different types of ringworm are usually named for the location of the infection on the body. Cats get ringworm when they come into contact with the fungus that causes the infection. That fungus can live on many surfaces, including blankets, grooming tools, and towels. It also lives on an infected human or animal's skin and hair."
upper respiratory infections,"Similar to the common cold in humans, this disease is common in cats that have been exposed to other cats, such as at a shelter. Respiratory tract infection (RTI) is defined as any infectious disease of the upper or lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include the common cold, laryngitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute rhinitis, acute rhinosinusitis and acute otitis media. An upper respiratory infection (URI) is an infection in the nose, sinuses, mouth, and/or throat. There are several infectious agents, both viruses and bacteria, that play a role in respiratory infections in cats."
worms,"Roundworm: These are the most common intestinal parasites found in cats; they're also visible to the naked eye. Roundworms measure anywhere between three to five inches long and look like spaghetti noodles. They steal nutrients from the food your cat ingests. The adult roundworms are 3 to 5 inches long, cream-colored, and live in the cat's intestine. The adult female worm produces fertile eggs that are passed in the infected cat's feces. The eggs require several days to several weeks to develop into the infective larva stage."
kidney disease,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the persistent loss of kidney function over time. Healthy kidneys perform many important functions, most notably filtering the blood and making urine, so problems with kidney function can result in a variety of health problems for a cat. Among the many different kidney diseases that may affect cats, CKD is the most common."
gingivitis,"Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums which can result in sore, red and swollen gums. It can be painful and lead to more serious dental problems if left untreated. Gingivitis in cats occurs when a build-up of sticky residue called plaque begins to form on your cat's teeth. Mild gingivitis does not affect the tooth root and home care of the teeth and may easily reverse most cases. Moderate gingivitis – is also very common. If plaque accumulates on the teeth, the gingiva will become more inflamed as time progresses. Sometimes gum recession can be seen at this stage."
periodontitis,"Periodontal (gum) disease is an infection of the tissues that hold your teeth in place. It's typically caused by poor brushing and flossing habits that allow plaque—a sticky film of bacteria—to build up on the teeth and harden. It starts with swollen, red, and bleeding gums. If left untreated, it can spread to the bones surrounding the gums, making it painful to chew. In the worst cases, teeth may become loose or need to be removed."
tooth resorption,"In a condition known as a tooth resorption –formerly referred to as feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion (FORL) or cervical line lesion—the dentin in a single tooth (or several simultaneously) erodes and eventually becomes irreparably destroyed. Stage 1 – These are early lesions extending less than 0.5mm into the tooth's neck. Stage 2 – These have significant erosions, which do not invade the endodontic system. Stage 3 – These are deep erosions invading the endodontic system."
obesity,"Feline obesity—generally viewed as body weight that is 20 percent or more above normal weight—is the most frequently observed nutritional disorder among domestic cats. Its clinical signs are clearly apparent and, when observed, should be taken seriously and addressed without delay. A cat starts being considered as overweight when its body weight exceeds 10% of its ideal weight. For example, if your cat's ideal weight is 3.4 kg (7.5 lbs), your cat is to be considered obese if it weighs more than 4.1kg (9 lbs), with 20% of 3.4 kg being 0.7 kg (1.5 lbs)."
pancreatitis,"If these enzymes become activated prematurely, they can seep into the pancreas and surrounding tissue, causing damage and inflammation. This disease is known as pancreatitis. It sits next to the stomach and small intestine and is involved in making enzymes for digestion, and it also makes insulin for control of blood sugars. Sadly 'pancreatitis' (inflammation of the pancreas) is quite common in cats."
hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism is a common disease in cats, and mostly afflicts cats middle-aged and older. Also called thyrotoxicosis, hyperthyroidism is caused by an increase in production of thyroid hormones (known as T3 and T4) from an enlarged thyroid gland in a cat's neck. Though functional benign enlargement (adenoma) is most common (98%), thyroid carcinoma (cancer) is another cause (2%). Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. This condition also is called overactive thyroid. Hyperthyroidism speeds up the body's metabolism."
