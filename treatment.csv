Disease,Treatment
squamous cell carcinoma,Surgical removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice for SCC in cats. Surgery is ideally attempted early in the course of the disease to ensure complete excision. Advanced imaging such as CT or MRI may be recommended to better determine tumor extent and aid in surgical planning.
lymphosarcoma,"Treatment for a cat that has been diagnosed with most forms of lymphoma typically centers around chemotherapy. A veterinary oncologist will determine the appropriate combination of chemotherapeutic agents to administer to the cat intravenously, often once weekly for many weeks depending on response to treatment."
diabetes,"Injectable insulin is a mainstay of treatment for feline diabetes. Unlike humans with Type II diabetes, oral medications to reduce blood sugar such as glipizide have not shown to be consistently effective in cats."
feline immunodeficiency virus,"There is no effective treatment, but supportive care and treatment of signs is important. This includes visiting the veterinarian at least every 6 months, promptly treating secondary infections, providing a balanced diet, controlling parasites, and removing tumors. FIV-infected cats should be spayed or neutered."
feline leukemia virus,"Unfortunately, there is currently no definitive cure for FeLV. Veterinarians treating and managing FeLV-positive cats showing signs of disease usually treat specific problems like prescribing antibiotics for bacterial infections, or performing blood transfusions for severe anemia."
heartworm,"Unfortunately, there is no approved drug therapy for heartworm infection in cats, and the drug used to treat infections in dogs is not safe for cats. Nevertheless, cats with heartworm disease can often be helped with good veterinary care. The goal is to stabilize your cat and determine a long-term management plan."
rabies,"There is no treatment or cure for rabies in cats. Once symptoms appear, a cat's health will deteriorate quickly and it will die within a matter of days. Your cat should be humanely euthanized to ease their suffering and to protect the other people and pets in your home. While there is unfortunately no cure for rabies once contracted, thankfully it's entirely preventable by keeping your cat up to date on their vaccinations and boosters."
ringworm,"If ringworm is diagnosed, treatment will typically involve the application of topical antifungal medications to all infected areas and, in most cases, a systemic medication as well. If the lesions are present in many areas of a cat's skin, a full-body rinse or dip may be used. The most common way to treat ringworm in cats is to use a combination of topical therapy (application of creams, ointments, or shampoos) and systemic oral therapy (administration of anti-fungal drugs by mouth). For treatment to be successful, all environmental contamination must also be eliminated."
upper respiratory infections,"Most upper respiratory infections in cats will resolve themselves with a little extra TLC and time. However, more severe infections may require treatment, prescription pet medication or even hospitalization. As a rule of thumb, a sniffly kitty that is still eating, active and feeling fine can be watched for a few days."
worms,"NexGard SPECTRA® Spot-On for Cats is an easy to use, topical cat dewormer that is effective against roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms and lungworms. Monthly treatment with NexGard SPECTRA® also protects cats against fleas, ticks, mites and heartworm."
kidney disease,"A cat in any stage with an increase in either UPC or high blood pressure will most likely be treated with medication. Based on the cause, additional therapy may be instituted, such as: Aggressive IV antibiotics, if infection is present. Deworming medication for parasites."
gingivitis,"For severe cat gingivitis, the vet may recommend the following treatment options such as Dental cleaning with dental radiographs, Antibiotic therapy, Anti-inflammatory medications, including corticosteroids or similar immune-modulating drugs, Stem cell therapy, Dental extraction, or removing all of the cat’s teeth for severe gingivostomatitis, Gingivectomy, or removal of some parts of the cat's gums."
periodontitis,"To treat feline periodontitis, your veterinarian will recommend removing plaque and mineral buildup by scaling and polishing the teeth while trying to save the teeth wherever possible. In extreme cases of periodontitis, extraction of teeth, sometimes of numerous teeth, may be required."
tooth resorption,"Treatment is guided by the radiographic appearance of the tooth resorption. With Type 1 tooth resorption, both the crown and root need to be extracted. With Type 2 tooth resorption, a technique known as crown amputation with intentional root retention is appropriate."
obesity,"Engage Your Cat's Natural Instincts. Instead, break their day's food up into several smaller meals, and put them in various places throughout your home. Kitty will enjoy the challenge of a “hunt,” and they will get some much-needed exercise. Place the food in elevated places to encourage jumping and climbing."
pancreatitis,Intravenous fluids will be given to maintain normal fluid and electrolyte balance and perfuse the pancreatic tissues. Analgesics will be given to control the intense pain. Many cases will also require anti-inflammatory drugs or other medication to control vomiting.
hyperthyroidism,"One way to treat a cat with hyperthyroidism is with an oral medication that contains methimazole. The medication can be given life-long or to stabilize the cat before other treatment options, such as radioactive iodine therapy or surgery."
