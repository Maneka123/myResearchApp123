squamous cell carcinoma,"Protect Your Feline From Excessive Sun Exposure

While cats don't develop the same types of skin cancers as humans do, they can get certain solar-induced cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma, especially in areas with less pigmentation, such as a pink nose or around the eyes and ears where there is white fur."
lymphosarcoma,"While lymphoma cannot be prevented, Dr. McEntee notes, the chances that a cat will develop the disease may be reduced through vaccination against FeLV, by preventing contact with FIV or FeLV infected cats, and by making sure it does not live in an environment contaminated by tobacco smoke."
diabetes,"A high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet is recommended. Weight loss is also an important component of diabetic management in overweight cats. Weight loss, if attempted, should ideally be gradual, one-half percent to 1% of total body weight lost per week."
feline immunodeficiency virus,"There is currently no vaccine commercially available  to protect against FIV, so the best way to reduce risk is to limit contact with cats who may be infected with the disease by keeping cats indoors and testing all cats within the household."
feline leukemia virus,"The only sure way to protect cats from FeLV is to prevent their exposure to FeLV-infected cats. Keeping cats indoors, away from potentially infected cats is recommended. If outdoor access is allowed, provide supervision or place cats in a secure enclosure to prevent wandering and fighting."
heartworm,"Right now, heartworm disease can only be prevented through the regular and appropriate use of preventive medications, which are prescribed by your veterinarian. These medications are available as a once-a-month chewable, a once-a-month topical, and a twice-a-year injection."
rabies,"Vaccinate and cats against rabies as required by law. All cats more than four months of age must be vaccinated against rabies. Keep vaccinations current at all times. Keep cats under control. Kittens should be vaccinated at 12-16 weeks of age to avoid interference from maternally derived antibodies and revaccinated 1 year later. Although some vaccines protect against virulent rabies virus challenge for 3 years or more, national or local legislation may call for annual boosters."
ringworm,It is important to remove pet hair from floors or furniture as it may be contaminated with fungal spores. Environmental contamination can be minimized by thorough damp mopping or vacuuming of all rooms or areas that are accessible to your cat; this should be done daily.
upper respiratory infections,"Minimize stress. Keep your cat up to date on vaccines as recommended by your vet. Vaccines for upper respiratory disease in cats may not prevent infection, but they can make one less severe. Regular veterinary exams and preventive care can help catch and treat problems early."
worms,"Make sure you regularly clean any poop out of your cat's litter tray to avoid reinfection with any worm eggs in your cat's faeces. If they have recently had worms, wash their bedding on a high temperature to kill any eggs that may be in it. Be sure to treat any other animals in your home for worms too."
kidney disease,"To help protect your cat from getting acute kidney failure, the best you can do is to limit your cat's exposure to toxins (especially lilies that are extremely toxic to kidneys) and make regular vet check-up appointments once or twice a year."
gingivitis,"The best way to prevent gingivitis in cats is to regularly remove plaque build-up by tooth brushing. It is important to use only tooth gel or toothpaste designed specifically for cats, as human products can be toxic to cats."
periodontitis,"Ideally, your cat's teeth should be brushed daily, but at least three times per week will still help with your cat's oral health and preventing gum disease. 
•	Brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.
•	Flossing regularly to remove plaque from between teeth. ...
•	Visiting the dentist routinely for a check-up and professional cleaning.
•	Quitting smoking."""
tooth resorption,"Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent tooth resorption in cats. Brushing your cat's teeth daily or every other day helps to decrease plaque and bacteria to slow gingivitis and periodontal disease. If your cat becomes painful or resistant to tooth brushing that they previously allowed, it may be a sign of oral pain."
obesity,"•	Ask your veterinarian to help you choose the most appropriate food for your cat. 
•	Portion control is critical. 
•	Consider using interactive feeding toys. 
•	Increase your cat’s exercise. 
•	Your veterinary healthcare team can assess your cat’s body and muscle condition score at each visit. 
•	Accountability keeps us honest. "
pancreatitis,"•	Avoid feeding your cat high-fat meals or table scraps and keep them at a healthy weight.
•	Keep your cat away from non-prescribed medications.
•	Avoid giving your cat drugs that can increase inflammation.
•	Be careful when using pesticides.
•	Bring your cat in for regular wellness visits. "
hyperthyroidism,"There are currently no known preventive measures for hyperthyroidism, but early diagnosis decreases the secondary problems and improves the prognosis. All middle-aged and senior cats should receive a complete physical examination by a veterinarian every 6 months."
